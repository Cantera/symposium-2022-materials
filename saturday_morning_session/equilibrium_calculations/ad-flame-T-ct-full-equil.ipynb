    "# Adiabatic Flame Temperature: Full Equilibrium with Cantera\n",
    "\n",
    "The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature achieved when a given fuel-oxidizer combination is combusted in a perfectly insulated reactor. If no energy is lost to the surroundings via heat transfer and the reaction occurs at constant pressure, conservation of energy dictates that the total enthalpy of the reactants is equal to the total enthalpy of the products. Defining _state 1_ as the reactants and _state 2_ as the products, we can write:\n",

In that Notebook, the input file was restricted to two product species, plus nitrogen. In real combustion applications, of course, a wide array of minor product species and side reactions are possible that can impact $T_{ad}$ in ways that we might care about.\n",

You can simply change the input file without changing any of your code to see the effect of different assumptions on your calculation."

These warnings are part of a validation check that Cantera does to make sure the thermodynamics data are consistent. In the standard NASA 14-coefficient polynomial form, the thermodynamics data are defined as two five coefficient polynomials (plus two other constants) over two temperature ranges. This is the form used for CHEMKIN files. The discontinuities occur when either the slope or the value of the thermodynamic functions ($c_p/R$, $h/(RT)$, or $s/R$) has a discontinuity at the mid-point temperature. Most commonly, one or more the discontinuities are due to incorrectly fit parameters, but they can also be caused by other means. You can learn how to debug these warnings in our [thermo debugging Notebook](../ncm-2019/thermo_debugging.ipynb).\n",
