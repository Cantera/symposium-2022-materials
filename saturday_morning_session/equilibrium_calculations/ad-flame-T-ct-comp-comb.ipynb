    "# Adiabatic Flame Temperature: Complete Combustion with Cantera\n",
    "\n",
    "The adiabatic flame temperature is the temperature achieved when a given fuel-oxidizer combination is combusted in a perfectly insulated reactor. If no energy is lost to the surroundings via heat transfer and the reaction occurs at constant pressure, conservation of energy dictates that the total enthalpy of the reactants is equal to the total enthalpy of the products. Defining _state 1_ as the reactants and _state 2_ as the products, we can write:\n",
