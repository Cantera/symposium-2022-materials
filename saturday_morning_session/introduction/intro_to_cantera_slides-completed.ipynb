    "If the magnitudes of the numbers in this list are all very small (which in this case they are), then each reversible reaction is very nearly equilibrated, which only occurs if the gas is in chemical equilibrium.\n",

    "You might be wondering how `equilibrate` works. (Then again, you might not.) Method `equilibrate` invokes Cantera's chemical equilibrium solver, which uses an element potential method. The element potential method is one of a class of equivalent *nonstoichiometric* methods that all have the characteristic that the probelm reduces to solving a set of $M$ nonlinear algebraic equations, where $M$ is the number of elements (not species). The so-called *stoichiometric* methods, on the other hand (including the Gibbs minimization), require solving $K$ nonlinear equations, where $K$ is the number of species (usually $K >> M$). See Smith and Missen's \"Chemical Reaction Equilibrium Analysis\" for more information on the various algorithms and their characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cantera uses a damped Newton method to solve these equations, and does a few other things to generate a good starting guess and to produce a reasonably robust algorithm. If you want to know more about the details, look at the on-line documentated source code of Cantera C++ class [`ChemEquil.h`](https://cantera.org/documentation/docs-2.4/doxygen/html/d4/dd4/ChemEquil_8h.html)."
