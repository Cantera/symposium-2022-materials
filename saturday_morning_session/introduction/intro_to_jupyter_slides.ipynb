    "\n",
    "This leads to one of the most confusing parts of Jupyter Notebooks - they are non-linear. Since the execution of any cell modifies the state of the kernel, it can be confusing to keep track of the state of a variable as you move around in the Notebook. For instance, executing a cell at the bottom of a Notebook that changes the value of a variable `a`, then moving to the top of the Notebook and running a cell that relies on `a` will work fine, but can lead to difficult to diagnose behavior. When in doubt, Restarting the kernel erases all of the stored state and let's you start from a fresh slate."
