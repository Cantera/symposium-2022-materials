Intuitively, as the temperature of an explosive mixture increases, it should ignite faster. But, under certain conditions, we observe the opposite. This is referred to as NTC behavior. Reproducing experimentally observed NTC behavior is thus an important test for any mechanism. We will do this now by computing and visualizing the ignition delay for a wide range of temperatures"
