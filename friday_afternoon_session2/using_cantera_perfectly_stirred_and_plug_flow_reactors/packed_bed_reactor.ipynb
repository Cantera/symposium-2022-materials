The gas at the inlet to the first one has the specified inlet composition, and for all others the inlet composition is fixed at the composition of the reactor immediately upstream. Since in a PFR model there is no diffusion, the upstream reactors are not affected by any downstream reactors, and therefore the problem may be solved by simply marching from the first to last reactor, integrating each one to steady state.\n",
